What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	- .git directory is created but no commits are created
	- you need to do it so that git creates the .git directory and stores the tracked files and their versions (commits)

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	- the staging area marks the content that will be added to the repository on the next commit
	- so you can decide which files will be included in the next commit and which not
	- this gives you the freedom to commit files one by one and have a distinct commit message for each file

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	- befor each commit make sure that the staging area only contains thouse files that contain that make up that logical change

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	- when you create an alternative version of your software to experiment with new features
	- when you maintain a stable production branch to release to your users and want to seperate the development of new features from that branch

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	- The diagrams visualize which commit is the parent of which commit
	- The latest commits are labeled with the name of the branch
	- This way you can trace back each branch to the commit it was forked from

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

	- Changes introduced compared to the origin commit will be combined in a new commit
	- Lines added compared to the origin will be included in the new commit
	- Lines deleted compared to the origin will be excluded from the new commit
	- Lines that have been changed in both branched represent a merge conflict and have to be investigated
	- The resulting commit has the latest commits of the merged branches as parents

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
